    title: "Onion Soup",
    text: `A bowl of rich, golden-brown onion soup, bursting with deep caramelized flavors and a hint of thyme, 
        warms your senses with every spoonful. The velvety broth, infused with slow-cooked onions and a touch of garlic, creates a comforting experience. Topped with a crisp slice of toasted baguette and bubbling melted cheese, 
        this French classic is both rustic and refined.

            Ingredients (serves 4):
            4 large yellow or white onions, thinly sliced
            2 tablespoons unsalted butter
            1 tablespoon olive oil
            2 garlic cloves, minced
            1/2 teaspoon sugar
            1/4 cup dry white wine (optional, or 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar)
            6 cups beef stock (or vegetable stock for a vegetarian version)
            1 teaspoon dried thyme or 2 sprigs fresh thyme
            Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

            For the toast topping:
            4 slices of baguette or rustic bread
            1 whole garlic clove (for rubbing)
            1 cup grated Gruy√®re cheese (or mozzarella or Emmental)

            Instructions:
            Caramelize the Onions
            In a large pot, melt the butter with the olive oil over low heat.
            Add the sliced onions and sugar. Cook slowly, stirring occasionally, for 30‚Äì40 minutes,
            until the onions are deeply golden and caramelized.

            Add Garlic and Deglaze
            Stir in the minced garlic and cook for 1 more minute.
            Pour in the white wine to deglaze the pot, scraping up the brown bits from the bottom. Let it simmer for 2‚Äì3 minutes.

            Build the Soup
            Add the stock and thyme. Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce to a simmer.
            Let the soup simmer uncovered for 20‚Äì25 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

            Prepare the Toasts
            While the soup simmers, toast the bread slices. Rub each with the whole garlic clove.
            Top with grated cheese and broil until golden and bubbly.

            Serve
            Ladle the soup into oven-safe bowls, place a cheese toast on top, and broil for 2‚Äì3 minutes,
            or simply place the toast on the soup just before serving.

            üç∑ Tip:
            This soup tastes even better the next day. Serve with a glass of chilled white wine and a small green salad for a cozy, elegant meal.`
